Weather Vain App

Please build a basic iOS app that takes in data from the 5 day forecast for a city of your choice from openweathermap.org and presents it to the user.

Your solution should at the very least display the min/max temperature for the next 5 days, as well as the weather (ex: "Rain") although the more you can add the better.
